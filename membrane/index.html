This is one of my first digital pieces. Experimenting with organic and textured drawings in Illustrator prompted me to learn many new skills in digital art. My inspiration for this piece was cell membranes and growth, exploring how those forms are reproduced by nature at various scales. While the membrane of a cell might have a very tight knit structure, the cells are also breathing and moving to continuously create new forms. Biomimicry through digital tools is a concept I strive to capture; how nature translates into digital tools and vice versa. </p>
