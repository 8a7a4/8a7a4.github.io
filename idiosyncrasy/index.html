This piece is an exploration of my inner creation space. As a result, I titled this piece "Idiosyncrasy", meaning the thought process unique to an individual. The abstract ways in which I create art are idiosyncratic to myself. The organic shapes and forms that appear in nature and within deteriorated industry inspire me to create work that is fluid and never-ending. As opposed to a singular focal point, this piece is a playground for the mind to explore freely. </p>
