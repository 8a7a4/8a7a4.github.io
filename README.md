This is less of a functional website, and more of a programming learning experience. This flask was used to create the base of my site: https://john-b-yang.github.io/flask-website/

I learned how to build a website, create and modify pages and posts, create a medu bar, create and modify background colours, create headers, and reorganize and personalizes pieces of templates.

I learned beginner CSS styling. Using two CSS style templates from W3 Schools templates: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp I created my own look with image previews.

I have included 2 of my works in the site so far as well as a cover photo which is a self-portrait. https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ This guide by Roger Dudler was very helpful to me. It taught me about repositories, adding and committing, and pushing changes.

This is an ongoing project for me as I teach myself to code interactive platforms. This programming project has been extremely challenging for me as I have worked independently with no prior experience.
